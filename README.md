# CarCrashTestingSimulator
A program to test the deformation caused to a car, using a car and a wall. If the car turns green upon impact (deformation < 80), it is good. If the car turns yellow (deformation > 80 and deformation < 180), it is average. If the car turns red (deformation > 180), it is lethal for the passengers.
